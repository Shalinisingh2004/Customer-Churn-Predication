# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue services, enabling businesses to take proactive retention actions.

## 📊 Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for customer relationship management. This notebook leverages supervised machine learning techniques to classify customers into "churn" and "non-churn" categories based on historical data.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## 📁 Project Structure

- `customerchurn.ipynb` - The core Jupyter Notebook containing all preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Label encoding for categorical variables
   - Standardization of numerical features
2. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- Add cross-validation
- Use additional algorithms like XGBoost or SVM
- Visualize feature importance and model comparison
